# Project Title
Clerkburk (CCP-Task-Manager)

## Future Plans
 * Implement AI task management
   * Find a way to implement an AI that can remeber parameters and inputs by the user
    * Implement a very simple chat bot which helps the AI to get information like for example the AI types on its on in the console: "/get task" and the AI will read the program's output and with that input it can work on its own.
    * Regularly ask the AI if it wants to do something.
 * Fix bug in which the program doesnt stop asking for input when interrupted early by a thread
 * Fill in Requirements in README.md

## Requirements

    "${file}",
    "-o",
    "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
    "-static" // Static linking
  ],
```
